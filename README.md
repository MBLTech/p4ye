Python for Everybody by Dr Charles R. Severance
## My Introduction
Hi! I'm Sajid. M.
This is my first ever programming course. Though I have been roaming around in the programming world for a while, but never tried to take this field seriously.
I have stumbled upon many youtube videos about programming in particular and python in general and found them quite intriguing and compatible with interest, so I 
seriously started thinking to take serious approach learn more about it.
So, I did little bit of research and found that python is the most beginner freindly to really start my programming journey, and I took this course to give myself 
a real taste of this world.

I have heard alot about this course from different reddit forums and then decided to take it myself.
Though there were more updated versions of this course on Udemy but I decided to stuck with the website itself: [Dr Charles R. Severance website](https://www.py4e.com)
