Python for Everybody by Dr Charles R. Severance

## My Introduction

Hi! I'm Sajid. M.
This is my first ever programming course. Though I have been roaming around in
 the programming world for a while, but never tried to take this field
seriously. I have stumbled upon many Youtube videos about programming in
particular and python in general, found them quite intriguing and compatible
with  my interest, so I  started thinking to take serious approach to
learn more about it. So, I did little bit of research and found that python is
the most beginner friendly programming language, to really start my programming
journey, and I took this course to give myself a real taste of this magical
coding world.

## Course Introduction

I have heard a lot about this course from different Reddit forums and then
decided to try it myself.Though there were more updated versions of this
course on Udemy but I decided to stuck with the website itself. Link:
