Tuples
"""
# Limited version of lists but are more efficient in term of memory management
# Immutable
# cannot sort, append, pop etc
# Tuples are comparable

# Sorting Dict by key

# di = {"a": 24, "c": 2, "d": 10, "b": 6}
# sort = sorted(di.items())
# print(sort)

# Sorting by Value

#     tmp.append((v, k))
# print(tmp)

# print(stmp)
